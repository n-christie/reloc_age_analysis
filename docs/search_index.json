To generate novel and significant knowledge on housing choices and relocation as related to active and healthy ageing, the objectives of this multistage mixed methods participatory project are to: Study housing choices, relocation and health patterns in the Swedish population aged 55+ (Register RELOC-AGE). Study housing choices and relocation and examine the effects on active and healthy ageing among people aged 55+ considering relocation (Prospective RELOC-AGE). Complete the development of a novel housing counselling intervention and a subsequent pilot study (Intervention RELOC-AGE). Contribute to theory development (Theory RELOC-AGE). "],["research-questions.html", "2 Research questions", " 2 Research questions What are the trends over time and by age when it comes to housing types and tenures? How do housing aspects and relocations affect future health outcomes? How are these patterns affected by age, sex, civil status, country of origin, adverse health events, loss of a partner, socio-economic and neighbourhood characteristics? Given equal propensity of relocation based on baseline demographic, socio-economic and health characteristics, how do specific housing decisions affect future health outcomes? What are the effects of adverse health events on housing choices and relocation patterns? What are the short- and long-term effects? How do these effects differ between men and women, across different disease and/or disability profiles, civil status, country of origin and socio-economic status? What aspects of housing and health predict: relocation to different housing options in the ordinary housing stock relocation to residential care facilities remaining in the present dwelling? How is the complex interaction between objective and perceived aspects of housing and social aspects associated with active and healthy ageing, and what are the characteristics and trajectories of such dynamics? What housing attributes do older adults considering relocation find important, and to what extent, when making their decisions on housing preferences? How do older adults considering relocation reason regarding: different housing options and motives for considering and effectuating relocation, and to what extent are their motives fulfilled? Is the newly developed housing counselling intervention usable, feasible and acceptable for the Swedish municipality context, and what are the pros and cons of different delivery formats? Which outcomes should be used to investigate the effectiveness of housing counselling, and what are the responsiveness and, the intervention effects on the selected primary and secondary outcomes, as indicated by the results of the pilot study? What are the main concepts and pathways of a theory on housing choices, relocation and active ageing?

In order to arrive at the final data set, a number of data cleaning actions, multiple joins, and many quality control steps have been taken to insure reliable analysis and data integrity. This section details steps taken. 4.1.1 SCB data A significant amount of data from the registrars originates from Statistics Sweden (SCB). This data is delivered in text format (file extension .txt), and is partitioned, for the most part, into individual files separated by both year and data set. With data covering about 3 million individuals over a period of decades and consisting of multitude of variables contained in hundreds of very large files, the computational effort to complete these joins are very time intensive, often taking hours for each merge, with progress occasionally hindered by computational restrictions and small errors which arise in the data cleaning process. With this in mind, detailed documentation, contained both here and alongside code used in the data cleaning, is prioritized to reduce any need to repeat these time-intensive processes. Raw data files are organized into folder structure where each folder contains all data from a particular data set. An individual script for each data set is written in R that reads the raw yearly .txt files and merges files into one data set. When required, a variable year is generated in the joined data set specifying which year the data originates from( taken from the name of the .txt file). Variables are renamed into lowercase with spaces and other delimiters transformed into underscores ( _ ) for consistent naming conventions and avoidance of future merge conflicts. The joined and cleaned data set is saved in the contained folder in both Rs .rds and Statas .dta formats. A README.txt file is created in each folder documenting the process. The result consists of eleven folders each containing a data sets respective raw data, a documented R merging/cleaning script for full reproducibility, and a merged data set in both R and Stata format to be used in subsequent merging and further analysis. 4.1.2 Joining data The first step taken is to combine the The data used in this analysis is the result of linking three different data sets. First, the population data set is matched on the much larger Lisa data set in order to return the unique Lopnrs from the Population data set that are found in the Lisa data set. Next, the matched Population/Lisa data is filtered based on the following criteria in order to minimized duplicates and repeat entries: After this filtering, the combined Population/Lisa data set is checked for duplicates in LopNr and year (690 duplicates removed, first case preserved), and then joined with the housing dataset on the unique combination of LopNr and year. 4.2 Population Description of Population data set 4.3 Lisa Description of Lisa data set 4.4 Housing Description of Housing data set "],["descriptives-by-age-and-sex.html", "5 Descriptives by Age and Sex", " 5 Descriptives by Age and Sex "],["404.html", "Page not found", " Page not found The page you requested cannot be found (perhaps it was moved or renamed).
