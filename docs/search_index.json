To generate novel and significant knowledge on housing choices and relocation as related to active and healthy ageing, the objectives of this multistage mixed methods participatory project are to: Study housing choices, relocation and health patterns in the Swedish population aged 55+ (Register RELOC-AGE). Study housing choices and relocation and examine the effects on active and healthy ageing among people aged 55+ considering relocation (Prospective RELOC-AGE). Complete the development of a novel housing counselling intervention and a subsequent pilot study (Intervention RELOC-AGE). Contribute to theory development (Theory RELOC-AGE). "],["research-questions.html", "2 Research questions", " 2 Research questions What are the trends over time and by age when it comes to housing types and tenures? How do housing aspects and relocations affect future health outcomes? How are these patterns affected by age, sex, civil status, country of origin, adverse health events, loss of a partner, socio-economic and neighbourhood characteristics? Given equal propensity of relocation based on baseline demographic, socio-economic and health characteristics, how do specific housing decisions affect future health outcomes? What are the effects of adverse health events on housing choices and relocation patterns? What are the short- and long-term effects? How do these effects differ between men and women, across different disease and/or disability profiles, civil status, country of origin and socio-economic status? What aspects of housing and health predict: relocation to different housing options in the ordinary housing stock relocation to residential care facilities remaining in the present dwelling? How is the complex interaction between objective and perceived aspects of housing and social aspects associated with active and healthy ageing, and what are the characteristics and trajectories of such dynamics? What housing attributes do older adults considering relocation find important, and to what extent, when making their decisions on housing preferences? How do older adults considering relocation reason regarding: different housing options and motives for considering and effectuating relocation, and to what extent are their motives fulfilled? Is the newly developed housing counselling intervention usable, feasible and acceptable for the Swedish municipality context, and what are the pros and cons of different delivery formats? Which outcomes should be used to investigate the effectiveness of housing counselling, and what are the responsiveness and, the intervention effects on the selected primary and secondary outcomes, as indicated by the results of the pilot study? What are the main concepts and pathways of a theory on housing choices, relocation and active ageing?

This data is delivered in text format (file extension .txt), and is partitioned, for the most part, into individual files separated by both year and grouped data set. While the data contained in this data originates from the specified data Registrars previously outlined, the data is received from SCB consolidated and grouped into various data sets which require further cleaning and processing. These grouped data sets are described below. 4.1 Population Description of Population data set 4.2 Lisa Description of Lisa data set 4.3 Housing Description of Housing data set "],["data-cleaning-and-joining-of-raw-data.html", "5 Data cleaning and joining of raw data 5.1 SCB data", " 5 Data cleaning and joining of raw data As illustrated above, the data from RELOC-AGE is comprised of from several registers and sources. In order to arrive at the final data set, a number of data cleaning actions, multiple joins, and many quality control steps have been taken to insure reliable analysis and data integrity. This section details steps taken. 5.1 SCB data With data covering about 3 million individuals over decades and with a multitude of variables spread out across hundreds of very large files, the computational effort to complete these tasks are very time intensive, often taking hours for a large merge, with progress occasionally hindered by computational restrictions and small errors which arise in the data cleaning process. With this in mind, detailed documentation, contained both here and alongside code used in the data cleaning, is prioritized to reduce any need to repeat these time-intensive processes. As a first step, the following initial data cleaning is performed: Raw data files are organized into folder structure where each folder contains all data from a particular data set. An individual script for each data set is written in R that reads the raw yearly .txt files and merges files into one data set. When required, a variable year is generated in the joined data set specifying which year the data originates from( taken from the name of the .txt file). Variables are renamed into lowercase with spaces and other delimiters transformed into underscores ( _ ) for consistent naming conventions and avoidance of future merge conflicts. The joined and cleaned data set is saved in the contained folder in both Rs .rds and Statas .dta formats. A README.txt file is created in each folder documenting the process. The result consists of eleven folders each containing a data sets respective raw data, a documented R merging/cleaning script for full reproducibility, and a merged data set in both R and Stata format to be used in subsequent merging and further analysis.

Data is taken from three SCB data sources: lev_lisa, lev_housing, and lev_population. The following steps are taken to arrive at a complete data set: The unique identifier lopnr in the lev_population data set is filtered with the following criteria: index_p ==1 &amp; ater_pnr == 0 &amp; sen_pnr == 1. Next this set of unique identifiers are matched to the full lev_lisa data set, resulting in lisa data that contains only the unique identifiers from the first step. 690 duplicate lopnr-year observations are identified and removed from the data set. Further inspection indicated this small number is a result of messy data, showing no trend or further information. As data from lev_lisa ends in 2019 and data from the lev_housing data set ends in 2020, time invariant variables(year of birth, sex, education, etc.) from unique individuals in 2019 are replicated for 2020 to facilitate the appropriate matching to the unique identifiers in the 2020 Housing data. Lastly, the data is joined by the unique lopnr-year combination with the lev_housing data. 7.1 Specific data considerations 7.1.1 Identifying partners There are some discrepancies in the data when finding consistent partner matches to unique individuals across the multiple data sets. We can find partner data in two of the datasets: partners_rtb and samh. In the partners_rtb dataset, we have three variables for every lopnr-year observation: Lopnrsamh  (no definition given in the excel sheet) 1987-1997. Lopnrsambo  sambos personummer from 1998. Lopnrmakpart  make/maka/partners personummer ( I believe this is technically married) from 1998. From the samh dataset, we have one variable: * LopNrSamh  (no definition given in the accompanying excel sheet). Since no particular partner variable was consistent over time, a new varaible is created, partner, that takes the value of whichever variable has valid data (of one of the above variables) for that lopnr/year. If there are two values, the priority is for the lopnrsamh from the partners_rtb dataset (it seems to have the best coverage). A screenshot for an particular individual with multiple partners over time to illustrate. 7.1.2 Recoding varaibles Education, housing type, housing tenure 7.1.3 Indentifying relocations To identify when an individual has relocated in the data the following considerations are taken into account. The housing variables, fast_lopnr and lghlopnr appear to uniquely identify the housing location of a particular individual. Over time, a change in either variable should indicate that an individual as relocated (highlighted in orange below). This change appears to be the best indicator of whether an individual has relocated or not. The coordinate variables, xkoord and ykoord appear to be occasionally inconsistent, giving different values for the same fast_lopnr and lghlopnr identifier in some of the data. This may be the result of data errors or possibly a GPS margin of error when measuring housing location (Highlighted yellow). The variable n_housing counts how many unique fast_lopnrs are associated with each lopnr. For example, individual RED, has resided in three locations, Individual BLUE has resided in two locations, and Individual 40 has resided in one location during the sample period. The vairalbes change_housing and change_tenure take the before and after values of housing and tenure (respectively) and return the before and after categories when a change (relocation) has occurred. Byggtyp appears to follow the patterns of fast_lopnr and lghlopnr, but contains some missing data. The missing Byggtyp value seems to be associated with the values Övriga hus and Specialböstader in housing. 7.1.4 Indentifying change in kommun In a similar fashion as identifying the change in a housing identifier over time for an individual, we can observe when an individual has relocated outside of a geographical area when the geographical indicator changes.
