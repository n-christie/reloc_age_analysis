To generate novel and significant knowledge on housing choices and relocation as related to active and healthy ageing, the objectives of this multistage mixed methods participatory project are to: Study housing choices, relocation and health patterns in the Swedish population aged 55+ (Register RELOC-AGE). Study housing choices and relocation and examine the effects on active and healthy ageing among people aged 55+ considering relocation (Prospective RELOC-AGE). Complete the development of a novel housing counselling intervention and a subsequent pilot study (Intervention RELOC-AGE). Contribute to theory development (Theory RELOC-AGE). 1.1 Research questions What are the trends over time and by age when it comes to housing types and tenures? How do housing aspects and relocations affect future health outcomes? How are these patterns affected by age, sex, civil status, country of origin, adverse health events, loss of a partner, socio-economic and neighborhood characteristics? Given equal propensity of relocation based on baseline demographic, socio-economic and health characteristics, how do specific housing decisions affect future health outcomes? What are the effects of adverse health events on housing choices and relocation patterns? What are the short- and long-term effects? How do these effects differ between men and women, across different disease and/or disability profiles, civil status, country of origin and socio-economic status? What aspects of housing and health predict: relocation to different housing options in the ordinary housing stock relocation to residential care facilities remaining in the present dwelling? How is the complex interaction between objective and perceived aspects of housing and social aspects associated with active and healthy ageing, and what are the characteristics and trajectories of such dynamics? What housing attributes do older adults considering relocation find important, and to what extent, when making their decisions on housing preferences? How do older adults considering relocation reason regarding: different housing options and motives for considering and effectuating relocation, and to what extent are their motives fulfilled? Is the newly developed housing counselling intervention usable, feasible and acceptable for the Swedish municipality context, and what are the pros and cons of different delivery formats? Which outcomes should be used to investigate the effectiveness of housing counselling, and what are the responsiveness and, the intervention effects on the selected primary and secondary outcomes, as indicated by the results of the pilot study? What are the main concepts and pathways of a theory on housing choices, relocation and active ageing?

This data is delivered in text format (file extension .txt), and is partitioned, for the most part, into individual files separated by both year and grouped data set. While the data contained in this data originates from the specified data Registrars previously outlined, the data is received from SCB consolidated and grouped into various data sets which require further cleaning and processing. These grouped data sets are described below. 2.1.1 Dataset overview Most of the descriptive data comes from LISA (lev_lisa in the table below), with more than 5 million individuals, over 128 million individual-year observations, and 95 variables across 30 years. The coverage of the other data sets is also documented, with linking of data sets possible by matching on a individual’s unique identifier, Lopnr.

In order to arrive at the final data set, a number of data cleaning actions, multiple joins, and many quality control steps have been taken to insure reliable analysis and data integrity. This section details steps taken. With data covering about 3 million individuals over decades and with a multitude of variables spread out across hundreds of very large files, the computational effort to complete these tasks are very time intensive, often taking hours for a large merge, with progress occasionally hindered by computational restrictions and small errors which arise in the data cleaning process. With this in mind, detailed documentation, contained both here and alongside code used in the data cleaning, is prioritized to reduce any need to repeat these time-intensive processes. As a first step, the following initial data cleaning is performed: Raw data files are organized into folder structure where each folder contains all data from a particular data set. An individual script for each data set is written in R that reads the raw yearly .txt files and merges files into one data set. When required, a variable “year” is generated in the joined data set specifying which year the data originates from( taken from the name of the .txt file). Variables are renamed into lowercase with spaces and other delimiters transformed into underscores ( _ ) for consistent naming conventions and avoidance of future merge conflicts. The joined and cleaned data set is saved in the contained folder in both R’s .rds and Stata’s .dta formats. A README.txt file is created in each folder documenting the process. The result consists of eleven folders each containing a data set’s respective raw data, a documented R merging/cleaning script for full reproducibility, and a merged data set in both R and Stata format to be used in subsequent merging and further analysis.

Data files from Socialstyrelsen includes inpatient and outpatient data ranging from 1987 to 2020. A particular area of interest in these data files is that of the reported International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes reported by the physicians from inpatient/outpatient visits. Closely examining the ICD codes, it is possible to not only classify individuals into groups according to specific risks (eg. high influenza risk), but also to observe outcomes(contracts influenza). This section documents the process of code extraction, classification, data cleaning, and details in working with the ICD codes reported by Socialstyrelsen. 4.1 ICD Code types There are a multitude of disease codes (ICD-10CM has around 70,000) which may differ slightly depending on which country uses them (18 different countries had national adoptions). The classification system has changed over the years, from ICD 8, ICD 9, to the contemporary ICD 10. ICD 11 is on the horizon. The follow are points that are helpful to keep in mind when working with ICD codes: Single ICD codes may be reported in different formats and need to be standardized (eg. A12.2 may be reported as A122 or A12200) Similarly, upper and lower case is often mixed across the data tables(eg. a112.b and A112.B) ICD code chapters (Kapitel) or sections (Avsnitt) are often reported in place of an individual ICD code. These are reported as a code range, such as “H00-H59”, but may take on various iterations which make matching and identification challenging (eg. “H00-H590”, H000-H590”,“H00-H599”, “H00-H99”. etc) ICD codes in the earlier years may need to be converted to ICD 10 for proper classification dependent on the time frame of analysis. 4.2 Decoding the codes - matching The approach taken to match ICD codes for further classification begins with identifying matches to the ICD code and code-ranges present in the Socialstyrelsen data with the corresponding definitions provided by Socialstyrelsen. Here, the task is to construct a linking table containing every ICD code, ICD Kapitel, and ICD Avsnitt along with the corresponding definitions and to which risk group they belong to, if any. This step is essential as much of the Socialstyrelsen data is reported in code ranges(eg. H00-H59), while the ICD codes found in the risk categories are reported as single codes (eg. H12). In constructing a linking table, translation of any ICD codes found in a particular data set into useful groups and categories becomes a simple task which aid not only this study, but any future study utilizing ICD codes. In the creation of the linking table, finding appropriate tables which list all Kapitel and Avsnitt ranges, across the variations of ICD-8, ICD-9, and ICD-10, proved challenging. The final matching table utilized multiple tables downloaded from Socialstyrelsen in Excel format, as well as tables only available in pdf format which required the manual extraction of code ranges to update the matching table. 4.3 Data cleaning process This section outlines the primary data cleaning and transformation steps taken to arrive at the final ICD data set. Examples are taken from the data set on inpatient visits to illustrate the process. First, we can examine the data after some initial merging and standardization of variable names. “lop_nr” is the unique patient identifier, “indatum” and “utdatum” are dates of check-in and check-out, “ar” is year of visit, while “hdia” corresponds to “hud diagnosis” or primary diagnosis, and variables “dia1” through “dia20” represent additional diagnosis codes. Here we see patient “X” has had four inpatient hospital visits in 2014. We can examine the second row and see the following: The main diagnosis (hdia) is given as “C15-C26” in this hospital visit, which is the same as Diagnosis 1 (dia1). This pattern is most commonly seen in the data, where Diagnosis 1 is identical to the Primary diagnosis. Additional diagnoses from the same visit can be seen across the columns dia1 through dia11. Here we notice duplicates, presumably because there are multiple and unique diagnoses that fall within the reported range of value “C76-C80”. To further investigate the multiple ICD codes from these single visits, it is helpful to transform the data from wide format to long format, where each row represent a single ICD code. This step facilitates the joining of descriptions and to classifications from the linking table and will prepare for subsequent analysis. The following table shows the data after transforming from wide to long, calculating the number of days per visit, and matching a ICD definition to the code (or code range) that is present in the data to the linking table. Duplicate ICD codes from the same visit are removed as they contain no further information. A column documenting which specific source file the definition originates from is also included to trace specific definitions back to the corresponding Socialstyrelsen document or table. Tables to match primarily originate from Socialstyrelsen and can be found here: https://www.socialstyrelsen.se/statistik-och-data/klassifikationer-och-koder/icd-10/ 4.3.1 Identifying the number of hospital visits Patient visits documented in the Slutvård data set are recorded in a manner which makes counting the number of stays in a particular period challenging. Often is the case where a patient will check out on a particular date, and check back in on the exact same date. While a cursory glance might lead one to conclude this phenomenon is the result of consecutive accidents or hospitalizations, the sheer number of occurrences of these back to back visits leads us to another conclusion - that when patients move from one ward to another, from the emergency room to the recovery ward for example, each record is recorded as a separate occurrence in the data set. Therefore these back-to-back observations are combined and counted as one visit under the assumption they represent the transfer of the patient from one ward or clinic to another. Calculations and conclusions are treated as such. To illustrate, in the above example, the we can see that the last two hopitalizations are back to back: the individual checks out on 09-30, then checks back in on the same date. When calculating the number of days hospitalized for this particular visit the individual experienced, we would sum the two values of days hospitalized ( 4 days and 16 days) to arrive at a combined total (of 20 days). "],["relocations.html", "5 Relocations 5.1 Identifying relocations 5.2 Descriptive statistics 5.3 Specific data considerations", " 5 Relocations Study period 2012-2020 when data is made available from SCB from the Real estate and Apartment registers. Data is taken from three SCB data sources: lev_lisa, lev_housing, and lev_population. The following steps are taken to arrive at a complete data set: The unique identifier lopnr in the lev_population data set is filtered with the following criteria: index_p ==1 &amp; ater_pnr == 0 &amp; sen_pnr == 1. Next this set of unique identifiers are matched to the full lev_lisa data set, resulting in lisa data that contains only the unique identifiers from the first step. 690 duplicate lopnr-year observations are identified and removed from the data set. Further inspection indicated this small number is a result of messy data, showing no trend or further information. As data from lev_lisa ends in 2019 and data from the lev_housing data set ends in 2020, time invariant variables(year of birth, sex, education, etc.) from unique individuals in 2019 are replicated for 2020 to facilitate the appropriate matching to the unique identifiers in the 2020 Housing data. Lastly, the data is joined by the unique lopnr-year combination with the lev_housing data. 5.1 Identifying relocations To identify when an individual has relocated in the data the following considerations are taken into account. The housing variables, fast_lopnr and lghlopnr appear to uniquely identify the housing location of a particular individual. Over time, a change in either variable should indicate that an individual as relocated (highlighted in orange below). This change appears to be the best indicator of whether an individual has relocated or not. The coordinate variables, xkoord and ykoord appear to be occasionally inconsistent, giving different values for the same fast_lopnr and lghlopnr identifier in some of the data. This may be the result of data errors or possibly a GPS margin of error when measuring housing location (Highlighted yellow). The variable n_housing counts how many unique fast_lopnr’s are associated with each lopnr. For example, individual RED, has resided in three locations, Individual BLUE has resided in two locations, and Individual 40 has resided in one location during the sample period. The vairalbes change_housing and change_tenure take the before and after values of housing and tenure (respectively) and return the before and after categories when a change (relocation) has occurred. Byggtyp appears to follow the patterns of fast_lopnr and lghlopnr, but contains some missing data. The missing Byggtyp value seems to be associated with the values “Övriga hus” and “Specialböstader” in housing. 5.2 Descriptive statistics Here we see that the vast majority of individuals who have relocated in the sample period have done so only once(82%), with a small proportion moving 3 times or more (about 3%) On the relocation level, we see that about 70% of revocations have been between some combination of Multi-dwelling and One-dwelling housing types, with a lower proportion of revocations into Special housing Here, at the housing level, we can see that those in Special housing are mostly in the 85+ category. 5.3 Specific data considerations 5.3.1 Translating types of housing and tenure (From Susanne): Hustyper och upplåtelseformer svenska/engelska Med bostadslägenhet avses en lägenhet avsedd att helt eller till en inte oväsentlig del användas som bostad, oavsett i vilken hustyp den ligger. Även bostäder i småhus definieras således som lägenheter. Upplåtelseform Lägenheternas upplåtelseform utgår från ägarförhållandet och inte hur de boende förfogar över lägenheterna Hustyp/Type of housing Småhus avser friliggande en- och tvåbostadshus samt par-, rad- och kedjehus (exklusive fritidshus). One-or-two-dwelling buildings means detached buildings as well as semi-detached, row and linked buildings (excluding buildings for seasonal and secondary use). Flerbostadshus avser bostadsbyggnader innehållande tre eller flera lägenheter inklusive loftgångshus. Multi-dwelling buildings means buildings with three or more apartments including balcony access housing. Övriga hus avser byggnader som inte huvudsakligen är avsedda för bostadsändamål men ändå innehåller bostadslägenheter, t.ex. byggnader avsedda för verksamhet/samhälls¬funktion. Other housing means buildings that are not mainly intended for residential purposes but still contains ordinary dwellings, e.g. buildings used for business/public function. Specialbostäder avser bostäder för äldre/funktionshindrade, studentbostäder, etc. Special housing means dwellings for older people, persons with disabilities, students, etc. Upplåtelseform Hyresrätt: Flerbostadshus och övriga hus med hyresrätt avser lägenheter som inte är ägarlägenheter och som ägs av andra än bostadsrättsföreningar/bostadsföreningar. Småhus med hyresrätt avser lägenheter som ägs av andra ägare än fysiska personer, dödsbon, bostadsrättsföreningar/bostadsföreningar. Rented dwellings: Multi-dwelling and other buildings with dwellings that are owned by other than housing cooperatives. One- or two-dwelling buildings with rented dwellings means apartments owned by other than private persons, estates of deceased persons or housing cooperatives. Bostadsrätt: Bostadsrätt avser lägenheter som ägs av bostadsrättsföreningar/ bostadsföreningar (äldre form som existerade innan 1930). Tenant-owned dwelling: One-, two- or multi-dwellings owned by housing cooperatives. Äganderätt: Småhus med äganderätt avser lägenheter som ägs av fysiska personer eller dödsbon. Flerbostadshus och övriga hus med äganderätt avser ägarlägenheter. Owner-occupied dwelling: One- or two-dwelling buildings with apartments owned by private persons or estates of deceased persons. Multi-dwelling and other buildings with owner-occupied dwelling means condominiums. Källa SCB, bearbetat av Susanne, 2022-09-08 Fotnot SCB: Både nyproducerade och existerande lägenheter, vilka tidigare utgjort bortfall i registret, registreras löpande. Därutöver sker rättningar och kompletteringar av tidigare felaktiga uppgifter samt till följd av att det befintliga beståndet förändras, t.ex. genom ombyggnad och rivning. Största delen av de lägenheter som redovisas som specialbostäder och övriga hus från 2013 och framåt ingick tidigare i kategorin flerbostadshus. 5.3.2 Identifying partners There are some discrepancies in the data when finding consistent partner matches to unique individuals across the multiple data sets. We can find partner data in two of the datasets: partners_rtb and samh. In the partners_rtb dataset, we have three variables for every lopnr-year observation: Lopnrsamh – (no definition given in the excel sheet) 1987-1997. Lopnrsambo – “sambo’s personummer” from 1998. Lopnrmakpart – “make/maka/partners personummer” ( I believe this is technically married) from 1998. From the samh dataset, we have one variable: * LopNrSamh – (no definition given in the accompanying excel sheet). Since no particular partner variable was consistent over time, a new varaible is created, “partner”, that takes the value of whichever variable has valid data (of one of the above variables) for that lopnr/year. If there are two values, the priority is for the lopnrsamh from the partners_rtb dataset (it seems to have the best coverage). A screenshot for an particular individual with multiple partners over time to illustrate. 5.3.3 Identifying change in kommun In the same fashion as identifying the change in a housing over time for an individual, we can observe when an individual has relocated outside of a geographical area when the geographical indicator changes. Variables may then be created to capture this trend. 5.3.4 Identifying houshold size As size of household is not present in the data (number of individuals inhabiting a particular residence), and estimate is constructed by the following combination of data items. First, total number of children living at the residence is calculated by summing the items: barn_0_3, barn_4_6,barn_7_10_barn_11_15, and barn_16_17. This estimate is augmented by 1 in the case of an individual living without a partner (no partner data available), or by 2 if a partner is living with that individual. For example, an individual who has 2 children and living with a partner would have an calculated household size of 4 (2 children + 1 partner + 1 self) 5.3.5 Identifying special housing A particular housing situation in the context of healthy aging is that of special housing, taken to be composed predominantly of care home type housing options. This attention has warranted a deeper look at how we can accurately identify whether or not an individual resides in a special housing. These are the considerations: Special housing may have entries in either the municipal registers or the Fastigehtsregister. In the municiple register we identify special housing when the variable sbo is equal to 1, or when the variable boskat is equal to 2. We create a new variable, special_housing, when either one of these conditions are true. In the Fastigehtsregister we identify special housing when the variable scb_boskat is equal to 1. We can examine some cross tabulations of our new special_housing variable ( from the municiple register) and the scb_bostkat variable from Fastigehtsregister (which takes on the value of 1 when special housing) "],["mortality.html", "6 Mortality 6.1 Seasonal mortality rates 6.2 Age distribution at death", " 6 Mortality 6.1 Seasonal mortality rates Among the numerous data items obtained from Social Styrelsen at the individual level, RELOC-AGE has access to time and reason of death. On a general level, it might be interesting to explore some mortality patterns in our data to elicit further research topics or specific research questions. Below, we plot seasonality in mortalities by year, where the x-axis represents the month of the year and the y-axis shows the proportion of yearly deaths occurring in a particular year. Each line represents one year in the sample. Here we see some striking patterns in seasonal mortality rates. We observe much higher mortality rates in the months of December, January, and March, with the low mortality rates in the Spring/Summer time. One could surmise the higher mortality rates in the winter months could be associated with higher accident rates due to cold weather, or depression related symptoms with the darker time of year. Of particular interest are the months of February, where we see a dip in proportional mortalities, and in March, where death rates spike. Other points of potential interest may lay in examination of the outliers - for instance the spike of mortalities seen in April 2001. 6.2 Age distribution at death Some general questions regarding mortality rates over time may be: are individuals living longer? In what age groups do we see the greatest mortalities? What is the age distribution in mortalities? Below we plot a histogram of individuals age at death in the years of our sample. A vertical line is drawn at the medial age of death for each particular year. First, the left-skewed figures in the early years of the sample expose a characteristic in the sample which requires consideration in any exploration of tendencies of centrality, that the sample does not have a equal representation of age across time due to the nature of the cohort data construction. In this sense, as the truncation on the right tail increases as time goes by, the distribution reverts towards what we would expect as representative beginning around the year 2009. Additionally, the truncation on the left tail is due to the age requirement for the cohort construction, with no deaths of younger individuals as there is a restriction on individuals date of birth for inclusion in the sample. In the absence of influencing factors, we would expect the age distribution at death to remain somewhat constant over the years on average. A right-shift in the distribution could be attributed to greater advances in heath care showing that individuals are living longer on average. By visual inspection there seems to be evidence of this pattern. Perhaps more interesting is the observed left-shift of the distribution in the last years of the sample, possibly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. The shift suggest more deaths at a younger age in 2021 compared to other years in the sample. Below, the same figure shows only the latter years.

As 2020 is covered in our sample, we can look at some patterns with COVID-19 diagnoses - the when, who, and where of hospitalizations in Sweden due to COVID-19. Using a list of ICD diagnosis codes, we can identify which patients were diagnosed with COVID-19 using the following criteria: ICD 10 code is equal to one of the following: U071, U072, U089, U099, U109, U119, U129, ZV100 Next, we can look at the following few graphs to give an idea of the data, as well as illustrate some patterns. A first question may be: How many days did patients spend in the hospital in 2020 due to COVID? Above we see a histogram of the number of days patients were hospitalized with a primary diagnosis of COVID-19. The distribution is heavily left-skewed, with the average number of days a patient spent in the hospital being 10.02 days. Below, we can look at the proportion of hospital stays due to COVID-19 by month in 2020. Two distinct peaks are observed in the data. While a monthly proportion may be interesting per se, simply looking at the number of cases by data may give a better view. Below looks at the unique hospital stays during 2020, filled in with the proportion of each ICD code. The ICD code “U071” is by far the most common code in the data. 8.1.1 Data considerations Looking at the ICD codes in the Slutvård data, we see that individuals may have multiple entries each year for hospital stays. Upon further examination, the vast majority of these “double entries” are back-to-back checkins. In other words, an individual seems to be released from the hospital and then checks back in the very same day, creating two (or more if repeated) entries. While these revolving door hospital stays could possibly be just that, the prevalence of these entries suggest a different mechanism at play - most likely a patient has changed wards or departments. For example, a patient may be admitted to emergency services for initial COVID-19 symptoms, but then transferred to an Intensive Care Ward, or a recovery ward, which would create three admissions. Below tallies the number hospital entries patients had for COVID-19. In the majority of cases, patients show having only one hospital entry during the year.
