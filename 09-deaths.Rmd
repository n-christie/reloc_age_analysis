# Mortality rates

## Seasonal mortality rates

Among the numerous data items obtained from Social Styrelsen at the individual level, RELOC-AGE has access to time and reason of death.
On a general level,
it might be interesting to explore some mortality patterns in our data to elicit further research topics or specific research questions.  Below,
we plot seasonality in mortalities by year, where the x-axis represents the month of the year and the y-axis shows the proportion of yearly deaths occurring in a particular year.
Each line represents one year in the sample.

Here we see some striking patterns in seasonal mortality rates. We observe much higher mortality rates in the months of December, January, and March, with the low mortality rates in the Spring/Summer time.

One could surmise the higher mortality rates in the winter months could be associated with higher accident rates due to cold weather, or depression related symptoms with the darker time of year.

Of particular interest are the months of February, where we see a dip in proportional mortalities, and in March, where death rates spike.  Other points of potential interest may lay in examination of the outliers - for instance the spike of mortalities seen in April 2001.


## Age distribution at death

Some general questions regarding mortality rates over time may be: are individuals living longer?
In what age groups do we see the greatest mortalities?
What is the age distribution in mortalities?

Below we plot a histogram of individuals age at death in the years of our sample.  A vertical line is drawn at the medial age of death for each particular year.

First, the left-skewed figures in the early years of the sample expose a characteristic in the sample which requires consideration in any exploration of tendencies of centrality, that the sample does not have a equal representation of age across time due to the nature of the cohort data construction.  In this sense, as the truncation on the right tail increases as time goes by, the distribution reverts towards what we would expect as representative beginning around the year 2009.

Additionally,
the truncation on the left tail is due to the age requirement for the cohort construction, with no deaths of younger individuals as there is a restriction on individuals date of birth for inclusion in the sample.

In the absence of influencing factors, we would expect the age distribution at death to remain somewhat constant over the years on average.  A right-shift in the distribution could be attributed to greater advances in heath care showing that individuals are living longer on average. By visual inspection there seems to be evidence of this pattern.

Perhaps more interesting is the observed left-shift of the distribution in the last years of the sample, possibly due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The shift suggest more deaths at a younger age in 2021 compared to other years in the sample.  Below, the same figure shows only the latter years.
